      <p>The next trial was no kinder than the last. As the Viking stepped out of the temple, it found itself standing before an endless labyrinth, stretching as far as the eye could see. The walls of the maze were alive, formed from towering hedges woven with thorns as sharp as daggers. Shadows danced across the ground, cast by the eerie glow of an unseen light, and the air was thick with an oppressive stillness.

        This was not a test of strength or intelligenceâ€”it was a test of patience.
        
        The Viking hesitated for the first time. A maze like this, bound by no mortal logic, could twist upon itself infinitely. Who could say how long it might take to find the exit? Perhaps even eternity would not be enough.
